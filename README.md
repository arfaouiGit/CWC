# Forecasting Cyberwar Escalation: An AI-Driven Multi-Scenario Framework for Emerging Technology and Geopolitical Risk

## Abstract

The accelerating evolution of cyber capabilities and the emergence of transformative technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing are reshaping the global security landscape. This dissertation introduces the **Cyberwar Clock Framework (CWC)**, a modular AI-powered forecasting model designed to simulate cyberwar escalation trajectories through the year 2036.

The CWC integrates machine learning, historical cyber incident data, and forward-looking risk indicators to quantify proximity to large-scale cyber conflict. In its initial implementation, the framework focuses on three indices:

- **Threat Evolution Score (TES)**
- **Geopolitical Tension Index (GTI)**
- **Cross-Domain Coupling Score (CDCS)**

These indices synthesize data from sources including the MITRE ATT&CK framework, national cyber capability rankings, SIPRI geopolitical datasets, and open-source threat intelligence.

Through time-series forecasting and scenario-based simulations using models such as **XGBoost**, **LSTM**, and where feasible, **Temporal Fusion Transformers**, the framework models cyber escalation patterns under varied technological and geopolitical futures. By moving beyond static or binary assessments, the CWC offers a data-driven, interdisciplinary methodology for forecasting cyber conflict riskâ€”supporting national defense planning, cybersecurity policy, and international strategic foresight.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

In an era of digital interdependence and strategic technological competition, cyberwarfare has emerged as a critical domain of international conflict. The proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities, coupled with rapid developments in AI and quantum computing, challenge traditional models of deterrence and strategic stability.

While existing risk assessments provide valuable qualitative insights, they often lack a dynamic, data-driven capacity to model escalation risk over time. This research proposes a forward-looking AI-based simulation framework to forecast cyberwar escalation scenarios.

### 1.2 Research Problem

Although cyber conflict is a recognized domain of geopolitical strategy, existing tools for escalation forecasting are often reactive, static, or binary in design. They typically fail to integrate the compounding effects of geopolitical instability, emerging technologies, and shifting threat landscapes.

This dissertation addresses the core question:

> **How can artificial intelligence be leveraged to build a predictive, scenario-based frameworkâ€”the Cyberwar Clock Frameworkâ€”that models and forecasts cyberwar escalation trajectories through 2036 using dynamic indicators of threat evolution, cross-domain risk, and geopolitical tension?**

The study initially focuses on three indicesâ€”TES, GTI, and CDCSâ€”to establish a foundational version of the framework, with plans to incrementally integrate more dimensions in post-doctoral research.

## 2. Research Objectives

- Develop a predictive AI-based composite framework, the **Cyberwar Clock Framework (CWC)**, based on escalating risk factors.
- Design and validate three core indices in Phase 1: **TES**, **GTI**, and **CDCS**.
- Train an AI-based forecasting model using historical and real-time data to simulate and predict cyberwar escalation patterns. Initial models will include **XGBoost** and **LSTM**; more complex models such as **Temporal Fusion Transformers** may be tested in later stages.
- Evaluate the accuracy, robustness, and policy relevance of the proposed framework using real-world benchmarks.
- Design the framework for modular expansion and include ethical risk guardrails to ensure responsible use in accordance with **Tallinn Manual** norms.

## 3. Significance and Contributions

This study contributes to the literature on cyber conflict forecasting by:

- Introducing the **Cyberwar Clock Framework (CWC)**â€”a novel, AI-enabled model for simulating cyber escalation under multiple futures.
- Operationalizing cyberwar escalation into an initial set of three measurable indices, with a roadmap for future index development.
- Demonstrating a phased, modular approach to risk modeling that enables gradual integration of complex variables such as quantum readiness and deterrence breakdowns.
- Offering practical tools for national security planners, cyber strategists, and international policy organizations to assess future conflict risks.
- Embedding ethical foresight and dual-use risk awareness directly into model design and outputs.
